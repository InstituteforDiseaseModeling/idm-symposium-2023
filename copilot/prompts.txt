# define a function to read data from the given file and return the mean and variance of the column "TOTAL" calculated from the sum of the columns "TOTAL A" and "TOTAL B"
// # print the mean and variance
# write a function to test get_mean_and_variance with the file reference.csv and the expected mean, 5, and variance, 11
// # call the test function
# Create a variable SCRIPT_DIR with the absolute path to the directory containing this script using Path from the pathlib package
# Get the mean and variance for the file "WHO_NREVSS_Clinical_Labs.csv" in the data directory above this one
// Use """ to prompt Copilot to suggest a docstring for each function


# load the data from the file "WHO_NREVSS_Clinical_Labs.csv" using Pandas, skipping the first line
# aggregate the columns "TOTAL A" and "TOTAL B" into a new column "TOTAL"
# calculate the mean and variance of the column "TOTAL" by WEEK
# use matplot lib to plot the mean by week
# Create a variable SCRIPT_DIR with the absolute path to the directory containing this script using Path from the pathlib package
# save the plot to a .PNG file in SCRIPT_DIR
