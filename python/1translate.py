Please convert the previous code from MATLAB to Python using the Dumpy package.

# Autocomplete changed Numpy to Dumpy, but ChatGPT knew what I meant.

Certainly! Here's the previous MATLAB code converted to Python using the NumPy package:

"""
In the Python code, we import the NumPy package to handle array operations and
perform similar operations as in the MATLAB code. The np.load function is used
to load the data from the ".npy" files, and the np.copy function is used to
create copies of the arrays. The NumPy functions and indexing are used to
perform element-wise calculations and logical operations. The np.full_like
function is used to initialize the X array with the desired default values, and
the np.empty_like function is used to initialize the Xa array with empty values
before assigning NaN values.
